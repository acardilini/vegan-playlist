## Current State

- **Phase:** Phase 0 — Discovery & Audit
- **Current session:** _between sessions (Sessions 0.1–0.3 complete)_
- **Next session:** Session 0.4 — Truth-source & data-source strategy
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-07

### Next Tasks (start here)
1. **Session 0.4 — Truth-source strategy.** All inputs are now in hand: the DB holds no
   curatorial data (0.2); truth lives in the curator's **spreadsheets**; the truth/enrichment/
   regenerable/dropped field classification is drafted in `SPOTIFY_API_AUDIT.md` §7. Design
   the authoritative model + spreadsheet-import + consolidation plan and record as a decision.
2. **Phase 1 prep:** get the curator's spreadsheets (song lists, lyrics, coding) into the
   repo or a known location so Sessions 0.4/1.1 can work against the real files.

### Known Context / Watch-outs
- Frontend is a ~2,000-line `App.jsx` monolith with inline pages — Phase 2 target.
- Backend has duplicate route files (`admin.js` / `admin_simple.js`) and ~40 one-off scripts — Phase 2 target.
- A separate, messy file of newly identified songs needs consolidating into the truth source — Phase 1.
- **Lyrics:** the curator is actively sourcing lyrics and has many more than the 10 links in
  the DB — but they live in the messy song lists awaiting cleanup. Bring them in during the
  Phase 1 consolidation.
- **Vegan-themes analysis is future work, not a bug:** `analytics/vegan-themes` reports 0
  because the thematic coding of songs hasn't been done yet. Plan it as its own workstream
  once the truth source is in place.
- Deployment must be cheap and GitHub-driven — decided in Phase 4.
- **The DB holds no curatorial data** (all categorisation/review/rating fields empty across
  1,208 songs) — the curated dataset lives in the curator's external files. Protecting "the
  650-song dataset" means protecting those files + the DB's enrichment (671 YouTube videos,
  654 moods, 493 genres, 10 lyric links). See `DATABASE_AUDIT.md`.
- ~~The `songs` table holds 1,208 rows, not ~650~~ **Solved (0.2/0.3):** 674 from the 2025
  imports + 534 synced 2026-04-06 after the Spotify playlist grew (curator: a vetted batch)
  — with 18 true duplicate pairs to merge in Session 1.1. Live playlist ("Animal Lib & Vegan
  Songs") now has 1,216 tracks; DB is 8 behind.
- **450 songs are missing album covers** (275 bare albums from the Apr-2026 sync — also no
  release dates, so year filters miss them; ~245 artists likewise bare). Not a Spotify
  limitation — backfill via saved spotify_ids queued for Session 1.2.
- The old DB password remains in public GitHub history (rotated 2026-07-06, so harmless for the DB) — **user to change it anywhere else it was reused**.
- Admin auth is still a shared password shipped in the frontend bundle (env var now, but visible to any visitor once deployed) — real auth is a Phase 4 requirement before the admin routes go public.

## Decision Log

Newest first. Each entry: date · decision · why.

- **2026-07-07 — Curator data decisions (from the 0.2 audit questions).** (1) The Apr-2026
  534-song batch is a vetted batch of new songs. (2) Curatorial coding lives in a couple of
  spreadsheets → they are the Phase 1 import source. (3) Mood/genre tags are **regenerable
  enrichment**, not curation — a more robust generation approach is future work. (4) **Drop
  audio features** (UI panels + analytics endpoint) — data is NULL and Spotify no longer
  provides it.
- **2026-07-07 — Sync endpoints re-pointed at the correct playlist.** The hardcoded default
  in `sync-spotify-playlist` / `spotify-playlist-mismatch` was an unrelated 500-track Lofi
  Girl playlist; one click of the admin Sync button would have flooded the DB and flagged the
  whole catalogue as removed. Default now `5hVygGomw9zax38quC6mhi` ("Animal Lib & Vegan
  Songs", verified live). Dataset-protection fix shipped mid-audit rather than waiting for
  the Phase 1 sync rebuild.
- **2026-07-07 — Curator confirmed the flagged inventory decisions.** Public playlist
  creation/mutation is **deferred** until a real auth story (Phase 4+); the two pre-auth
  admin test routes were **removed immediately** (`admin.js` — one wrote `songs.featured`
  with no password). Verified post-fix: both return 401; public API unaffected.
- **2026-07-07 — Feature Inventory decisions recorded** in
  [`FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`](./FEATURE_INVENTORY.md): all public screens and curation tooling
  **keep**; Spotify sync **rebuild** in Phase 1 (truth-source boundary); ~20 debug/superseded
  endpoints, `admin_simple.js`, dead `ArtistsPage`, and 3 DDL-over-HTTP endpoints **drop**
  (Phase 2); public playlist creation **defer** pending auth (⚑ user to confirm the flagged
  items). Rationale: preserve every behaviour the curator relies on; remove only what nothing
  calls.
- **2026-07-06 — Security cleanup before Phase 0.** Rotated the Postgres password (old one was
  committed to public GitHub history via `.claude/settings.local.json`); untracked and
  gitignored that file; moved the admin password out of frontend source into env vars
  (`ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and rotated it; removed password logging from the
  admin auth middleware. Proper admin authentication deferred to Phase 4 (YAGNI — env-var
  shared password suffices while local-only).
- **2026-07-06 — One living state doc.** Current-state and decision log live together in this
  file (not split) — simplest thing that works (YAGNI). Revisit if it grows unwieldy.
- **2026-07-06 — Modernise, don't rewrite.** Preserve backend + PostgreSQL + 650-song dataset;
  rebuild frontend and ops layer. A greenfield rewrite risks losing subtle, hard-won logic and
  curation. Feature Inventory (Phase 0) is the safety net.
- **2026-07-06 — Truth source becomes the curated dataset; Spotify becomes enrichment.** A song
  exists because the curator says so, not because it's on a Spotify playlist. Spotify fills
  details where a match exists and never overwrites curatorial data. Enables multi-platform
  songs (Bandcamp, YouTube, etc.).
- **2026-07-06 — Retain the tech stack** (React/Vite, Node/Express, PostgreSQL). The pain is
  architecture/brand/deployment, not the stack itself.
- **2026-07-06 — Phased approach adopted** (Phases 0–4). Code-changing sessions end with a
  smoke test.

## Changelog

Newest first. What actually happened each session.

- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.3)** — Spotify API audit complete → `docs/SPOTIFY_API_AUDIT.md`.
  Live-tested the API with the app's credentials: album images fully available (the missing
  covers are our sync's bug — 450 songs affected, backfillable); audio features (403),
  recommendations/related-artists (404), and preview URLs confirmed dead for this app; the
  real playlist is "Animal Lib & Vegan Songs", 1,216 tracks (DB 8 behind). Truth vs
  enrichment field classification drafted for Session 0.4. **Fix shipped:** sync endpoints'
  default playlist ID pointed at an unrelated Lofi Girl playlist — corrected to the real one
  (server reload + route smoke test ✅; sync itself intentionally not run). Curator answered
  the four 0.2 questions (recorded in Decision Log).
- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.2)** — Database audit complete → `docs/DATABASE_AUDIT.md`
  (read-only; no code changes, smoke test n/a). Headlines: **no curatorial data in the DB**
  (all categorisation/review fields = 0 rows); 1,208 songs = 674 (Jul–Aug 2025 imports, with
  moods/genres/playlist-dates) + 534 (bare 2026-04-06 import, origin ⚑ unconfirmed); id
  sequence at 5,195 → ~4k rows of historic churn; 18 true duplicate pairs identified; audio
  features + preview URLs NULL for all songs (Spotify API no longer provides them); live
  `songs` table has 51 columns vs 23 in `schema.sql`, much of it in no SQL file;
  `database/migrations/` is empty. Four open questions for the curator recorded in the audit.
- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.1 follow-up)** — Removed the two unauthenticated admin test routes
  from `backend/routes/admin.js` (the pre-auth `test-update/:id` and `test-featured-noauth/:id`,
  the latter writing `songs.featured` without a password). Smoke test: both endpoints now 401
  without credentials, `db-stats` still 200 ✅. Recorded curator confirmations (playlist
  deferral) and new context (lyrics being sourced in messy lists; vegan-themes coding is
  future work) in the inventory and this doc.
- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.1)** — Feature Inventory complete → `docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`.
  Walked all 11 frontend routes, 9 admin tabs, and ~100 backend endpoints (every route group
  verified live). Key finds: `admin_simple.js` never mounted; `ArtistsPage` in `App.jsx` dead;
  duplicate route definitions inside `admin.js`; **two admin test routes mounted before the
  auth middleware — one writes `songs.featured` unauthenticated (verified)**; 3 endpoints run
  schema DDL over HTTP; lyrics route file unused by the frontend; live data = 1,208 songs /
  558 artists / 721 albums, lyrics links on 10 songs, vegan-theme analytics empty. Populated
  the Backlog in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`; updated PRD §11 pointer and `CLAUDE.md` architecture
  section. No code changed (audit only — smoke test n/a). / `stop-vegan-playlist.bat` launcher
  scripts (start opens both servers in titled log windows + browser, with already-running
  guard; stop kills by window title and by port 5000/5173). Smoke test: full
  stop → start → re-start cycle verified ✅. Documented in README Quick Start.

- **2026-07-06** — Security cleanup: rotated DB + admin passwords, moved admin password to env
  vars (8 frontend components), untracked/gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, removed
  password logging, expanded `.env.example` files, removed stray `backend/nul`. Smoke test:
  DB connection ✅, admin auth new password 200 / old 401 ✅, frontend 200 ✅. Discovered
  `songs` table has 1,208 rows (vs ~650 expected) — flagged for Session 0.2.
- **2026-07-06** — Modernisation planning established: created `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`,
  `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`; updated `PRD.md` with the as-built feature inventory;
  updated `CLAUDE.md` with the Start/End-Session workflow and YAGNI principle.
