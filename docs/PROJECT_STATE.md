# The Vegan Playlist — Project State

_This is the **living document**. Read it at the start of every session; update it at the end._

## Current State

- **Phase:** Phase 0 — Discovery & Audit
- **Current session:** _between sessions (Session 0.1 complete)_
- **Next session:** Session 0.2 — Database audit
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-07

### Next Tasks (start here)
1. **Session 0.2 — Database audit** (schema, counts, data quality). First questions: why
   1,208 songs vs ~650 expected (check `removed_from_playlist`, `data_source`, duplicates);
   document the real live schema (base `schema.sql` + 6 add-on SQL files + HTTP-DDL endpoints
   have diverged from any file).
2. **Session 0.3 — Spotify API audit** (what's pulled, what's available, sync, rate limits).
   Note: Spotify deprecated the audio-features API for new apps (Nov 2024) — check our access.
3. **Session 0.4 — Truth-source strategy** (design authoritative model + consolidation plan).

### Known Context / Watch-outs
- Frontend is a ~2,000-line `App.jsx` monolith with inline pages — Phase 2 target.
- Backend has duplicate route files (`admin.js` / `admin_simple.js`) and ~40 one-off scripts — Phase 2 target.
- A separate, messy file of newly identified songs needs consolidating into the truth source — Phase 1.
- **Lyrics:** the curator is actively sourcing lyrics and has many more than the 10 links in
  the DB — but they live in the messy song lists awaiting cleanup. Bring them in during the
  Phase 1 consolidation.
- **Vegan-themes analysis is future work, not a bug:** `analytics/vegan-themes` reports 0
  because the thematic coding of songs hasn't been done yet. Plan it as its own workstream
  once the truth source is in place.
- Deployment must be cheap and GitHub-driven — decided in Phase 4.
- The `songs` table holds **1,208 rows**, not the ~650 expected — investigate in Session 0.2 (may include removed/flagged/duplicate songs).
- The old DB password remains in public GitHub history (rotated 2026-07-06, so harmless for the DB) — **user to change it anywhere else it was reused**.
- Admin auth is still a shared password shipped in the frontend bundle (env var now, but visible to any visitor once deployed) — real auth is a Phase 4 requirement before the admin routes go public.

## Decision Log

Newest first. Each entry: date · decision · why.

- **2026-07-07 — Curator confirmed the flagged inventory decisions.** Public playlist
  creation/mutation is **deferred** until a real auth story (Phase 4+); the two pre-auth
  admin test routes were **removed immediately** (`admin.js` — one wrote `songs.featured`
  with no password). Verified post-fix: both return 401; public API unaffected.
- **2026-07-07 — Feature Inventory decisions recorded** in
  [`FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`](./FEATURE_INVENTORY.md): all public screens and curation tooling
  **keep**; Spotify sync **rebuild** in Phase 1 (truth-source boundary); ~20 debug/superseded
  endpoints, `admin_simple.js`, dead `ArtistsPage`, and 3 DDL-over-HTTP endpoints **drop**
  (Phase 2); public playlist creation **defer** pending auth (⚑ user to confirm the flagged
  items). Rationale: preserve every behaviour the curator relies on; remove only what nothing
  calls.
- **2026-07-06 — Security cleanup before Phase 0.** Rotated the Postgres password (old one was
  committed to public GitHub history via `.claude/settings.local.json`); untracked and
  gitignored that file; moved the admin password out of frontend source into env vars
  (`ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and rotated it; removed password logging from the
  admin auth middleware. Proper admin authentication deferred to Phase 4 (YAGNI — env-var
  shared password suffices while local-only).
- **2026-07-06 — One living state doc.** Current-state and decision log live together in this
  file (not split) — simplest thing that works (YAGNI). Revisit if it grows unwieldy.
- **2026-07-06 — Modernise, don't rewrite.** Preserve backend + PostgreSQL + 650-song dataset;
  rebuild frontend and ops layer. A greenfield rewrite risks losing subtle, hard-won logic and
  curation. Feature Inventory (Phase 0) is the safety net.
- **2026-07-06 — Truth source becomes the curated dataset; Spotify becomes enrichment.** A song
  exists because the curator says so, not because it's on a Spotify playlist. Spotify fills
  details where a match exists and never overwrites curatorial data. Enables multi-platform
  songs (Bandcamp, YouTube, etc.).
- **2026-07-06 — Retain the tech stack** (React/Vite, Node/Express, PostgreSQL). The pain is
  architecture/brand/deployment, not the stack itself.
- **2026-07-06 — Phased approach adopted** (Phases 0–4). Code-changing sessions end with a
  smoke test.

## Changelog

Newest first. What actually happened each session.

- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.1 follow-up)** — Removed the two unauthenticated admin test routes
  from `backend/routes/admin.js` (the pre-auth `test-update/:id` and `test-featured-noauth/:id`,
  the latter writing `songs.featured` without a password). Smoke test: both endpoints now 401
  without credentials, `db-stats` still 200 ✅. Recorded curator confirmations (playlist
  deferral) and new context (lyrics being sourced in messy lists; vegan-themes coding is
  future work) in the inventory and this doc.
- **2026-07-07 (Session 0.1)** — Feature Inventory complete → `docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`.
  Walked all 11 frontend routes, 9 admin tabs, and ~100 backend endpoints (every route group
  verified live). Key finds: `admin_simple.js` never mounted; `ArtistsPage` in `App.jsx` dead;
  duplicate route definitions inside `admin.js`; **two admin test routes mounted before the
  auth middleware — one writes `songs.featured` unauthenticated (verified)**; 3 endpoints run
  schema DDL over HTTP; lyrics route file unused by the frontend; live data = 1,208 songs /
  558 artists / 721 albums, lyrics links on 10 songs, vegan-theme analytics empty. Populated
  the Backlog in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`; updated PRD §11 pointer and `CLAUDE.md` architecture
  section. No code changed (audit only — smoke test n/a). / `stop-vegan-playlist.bat` launcher
  scripts (start opens both servers in titled log windows + browser, with already-running
  guard; stop kills by window title and by port 5000/5173). Smoke test: full
  stop → start → re-start cycle verified ✅. Documented in README Quick Start.

- **2026-07-06** — Security cleanup: rotated DB + admin passwords, moved admin password to env
  vars (8 frontend components), untracked/gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, removed
  password logging, expanded `.env.example` files, removed stray `backend/nul`. Smoke test:
  DB connection ✅, admin auth new password 200 / old 401 ✅, frontend 200 ✅. Discovered
  `songs` table has 1,208 rows (vs ~650 expected) — flagged for Session 0.2.
- **2026-07-06** — Modernisation planning established: created `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`,
  `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`; updated `PRD.md` with the as-built feature inventory;
  updated `CLAUDE.md` with the Start/End-Session workflow and YAGNI principle.
